Thank you honorable chair, distinguished guests and all debaters. Just before, we've witnessed a fascinating debate on the motion"This House regrets the overemphsis of advanced degrees". After thorough deliberation, here's our decision. 

# 1. focus

Today's debate centered on 4 core issues: 
1. Whether pursuing advanced degree misallocation of time
2. The role of degree inflation in worsening educational inequality
3. Whether advanced degree create zero-sum game
4. Responsibility for the degree inflation, the market, the world trend or the gov policy
The upper house almost dorminated the discussion on those questions while the lower house, though rich in data, lack pursuasive warrents.

POIs are generally well organized, though some lacked full consideration, for instance, the OW’s time-exceeding POI to the PM disrupted the flow.

# 2. team rankings

**4th place: closing opposion(CO)**

+ The OW violated the rules by introduceing new analytical data in his speech. Meanwhile, his cross-country comparisons on degree emphasis lack depth, rendering the argument untenable. 
+ The Member of Opposition’s case for intellectual excellence through advanced learning was compelling but failed to address the LO’s POI directly—a critical oversight.

**3rd place: the closing proposition(CP)**

+ MP seemed to prepared a lot, but her delivery was disrupted by rebutting 2 POIs and the argument of DLO. The sole clear argument-discrimination and inequality-echoed the OG without adding new analysis. 
+ The PW's use of survivorship bias was insightful but logically flawed, as raised by a POI: both job markets and degree requiring exhibiting biases. 

**2nd place: the open proposition(OP)**

+ The PM’s definition was astute, and their arguments on career pressures and degree inflation were strong. However, their inequality claims needed further justification.
+ The DPM’s manufacturing transformation argument was innovative but offered weak rebuttals to the LO’s points.

**1st place: the opening opposion(OO)**

+ The Leader of Opposition delivered a logically structured rebuttal, though their third argument (on government action) needed concrete policy measures.
+ The DLO’s speech was exemplary in clarity and data use, though their rebuttal (‘lack of confidence’) lacked a developed logic chain. 

# 3. best speaker

Best speaker is awarded to the Deputy Leader of Opposition for his sharp rebuttals, clear structure, and effective data usage—despite occasional gaps in logical progression.

# 4. feedback

3 overarching observations fot both houses.

1. *The motion’s premise—‘overemphasis’—wasn’t critically examined. Is it systemic or a mismatch between individual expectations and job demands?*  
2. *Neither side explored the root causes of degree inflation (e.g., technological shifts).*  
3. *The cultural metaphor ‘孔乙己的长衫’ (symbolizing degree-holders’ entitlement) was overlooked—a missed opportunity to deepen the societal analysis."

this concludes my decision, thank you!
